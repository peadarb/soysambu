# Summary

## Context

The Social Assessment for Protected and Conserved Areas (SAPA) is a standardised, low-cost and relatively simple approach to assessing social impacts of protected or conserved areas. SAPA can help identify positive and negative social impacts of protected or conserved areas, understand the underlying causes of problems related to governance and identify actions that could improve the situation. The methodology can also be used to establish a baseline for social impacts and their overall contribution to human wellbeing against which changes can be tracked over time. It is a multi-stakeholder assessment methodology for use by site-level stakeholders. 

## Key Findings

### Positive social impacts

Based on the findings of the SAPA process, the main positive social impacts that contributed to household well-being in communities neighbouring or within Soysambu Conservancy were: 
1) Improving access to water
2) Building or maintaining infrastructure
3) Support for education
4) Support for health projects
5) Outreach services and training

Soysambu conservancy provides water to the community either through trucks or by building water tanks, ensuring access to clean and safe water for local residents. 

<!-- quote -->
> Soysambu are amazing for proving access to water

Soysambu conservancy's support in building or maintaining infrastructure including police posts, schools, and roads, were reported to enhance the overall quality of life for community members.

Soysambu conservancy’s initiative to offer sponsorship opportunities for students, enabling access to education and fostering academic achievement, was seen as a positive social impact by some households. Additionally, Soysambu's contributions to local schools, such as providing school meals for students, school uniforms, desks, and sports equipment, positively impact educational outcomes and student well-being. The Conservancy also provides free guided educational trips to community members, offering valuable learning experiences and fostering appreciation for conservation efforts.

Soysambu conservancy’s support for health projects, including the provision of equipment to clinics and cancer screening for women, contributed to improved healthcare access and outcomes within the community. Additionally, Soysambu Conservancy also provided anti-rabies vaccinations for dogs and donkeys, demonstrating a commitment to community health.

Soysambu conservancy also offered outreach services in the form of training in improved livestock production, health, and waste management, empowering residents with valuable knowledge and skills.

Soysambu actively participates in environmental conservation initiatives, such as tree planting, contributing to the preservation of natural resources and biodiversity. Furthermore, some households also felt that providing access to firewood also demonstrated a commitment to community support.

### Negative social impacts

Most negative social impacts across the six case studies fall under five main categories:
1) Ecosystem service benefits
2) PA-related employment
3) PA-supported development projects
4) Reduced human-wildlife conflict, and
5) Improved security

> Scholarships should be transparent and target vulnerable children


<!-- quote -->
> My child needs compensation. He was injured by a buffalo and was a security in conservancy

### Overall contribution to wellbeing

The survey results indicated that the majority of respondents perceived Soysambu's overall contribution to well-being as neutral, taking into account both positive and negative impacts. There were exceptions, particularly in Oljorai and Mbaruk locations, where a few respondents felt that Soysambu had increased their well-being. 

Interestingly, over `r big_numbers("75%")` of respondents residing within Soysambu felt that the conservancy had increased their well-being. On the other hand, approximately `r big_numbers("12%")` of respondents living in Oljorai agreed that Soysambu had reduced their overall well-being.

### Governance

SAPA encompasses four key principles of effective governance:  participation in decision-making, transparency and accessibility to information, mitigation of negative impacts, and equitable benefit-sharing process.

#### Participation

In Mbaruk and Oljorai locations, the majority of people disagree that there is participation in Soysambu’s decision-making that impacts the community. However, in Soysambu itself, a large percentage of people feel that there is some level of participation, particularly in knowing their community representative for meetings with Soysambu and communicating with them. In Kiptangwani, there is a mix in opinions with most people feeling that there is no participation, some agreeing that there is participation, and quite a number do not know whether there is any participation.

#### Transparency and access to information

`r big_numbers("75%", "Did one thing")`

#### Rights

#### Benefit Sharing Process

#### Mitigation of Negative Impacts

### Recommendations going forward

Given that there are significant differences between locations, we recommend xyz

# Introduction

## Soysambu Conservancy

Soysambu Conservancy is located within the Rift Valley System. It covers 48,000 acres, encompassing the northern and western shores of Lake Elmenteita. Soysambu Conservancy is renowned for its remarkable biodiversity, including a population of 170 endangered Nubian Giraffes and over 450 bird species, notably hosting 28% of the world's Lesser Flamingo population. Indeed Lake Elmentaita is one of Kenya's Key Biodiversity Areas and RAMSAR sites^[a wetland that is of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, also known as the "Convention on Wetlands"]. Its rich wildlife habitat is home to buffalo, leopard, hippo, hyena, jackal, eland, zebra, impala, Thompson’s and Grant’s Gazelle, waterbuck, reedbuck, klipspringer, warthog, steinbok, colobus monkey, vervet monkey, and baboons.

Soysambu Conservancy was established as a Not-for-Profit Company on April 13th, 2007 and works to conserve the Soysambu Estate as a traditional wildlife area, which supports the integrity of the greater Rift Valley ecosystem, while promoting sustainable coexistence of wildlife with livestock and at the same time being relevant to and part of modern-day Kenya. 

Soysambu Conservancy wanted to understand more about the social impact of the conservancy on communities living within and surround the conservancy. Furthermore, they wanted to use the opportunity of assessing the social impacts of the Conservancy to listen to what communities within and surrounding the conservancy had to say about the positive and negative impacts of the Conservancy. This could also serve as an opportunity to establish a baseline for Soysambu Conservancy's contribution to the well-being of communities, over time.


## The Social Assessment of Protected Areas (SAPA) approach

The Social Assessment for Protected and Conserved Areas (SAPA), launched in 2014, responded to a need for a standardised, low-cost and relatively simple approach to assessing social impacts of protected or conserved areas. 

SAPA is a multi-stakeholder assessment methodology for use by site-level stakeholders. The methodology is based on a standardised process that can be replicated across protected or conserved areas while remaining flexible enough for tailoring to local needs and contexts. SAPA uses a set of standard assessment questions directly related to social impacts and governance quality. It also includes a process of developing site-specific questions that respond to specific needs of actors. 

SAPA can help identify positive and negative social impacts of protected or conserved areas, understand the underlying causes of problems related to governance and identify actions that could improve the situation. The inclusion of a governance and equity assessment in the second edition of SAPA strengthens the results and action planning processes. Governance is distinct from management and pays attention to who defines objectives and how. It also looks at allocation of responsibility and accountability for delivering on these objectives.

The methodology can also be used to establish a baseline for social impacts and their overall contribution to human wellbeing against which changes can be tracked over time. Therefore, the SAPA approach meets the requirements of Soysambu Conservancy as they seek to understand social impacts over time, and to listen to feed back from communities living within and surrounding the conservancy. 

## Objectives of the Social Assessment

Soysambu Conservancy aims to ensure that they provide value to Kenya, its people and the wider international community through sustainable conservation and enjoyment as a national treasure and heritage. 

The conservancy is currently expanding its engagement with communities living within and surrounding the conservancy. Conducting a SAPA will therefore help them better understand the views, needs, and opportunities of the surrounding communities. 

The primary objective of this assessment therefore was to integrate conservation initiatives with community development and foster a positive relationship between Soysambu and their neighbouring communities, principally by increasing positive impacts and reducing negative impacts to communities.

# Approach and Methods

<div class ="wrap-columns">
<div class ="column-50">

## SAPA overview, process and outputs

The SAPA Assessment uses a mixed methods approach that combines qualitative data and quantitative data to gather information, assess results and generate ideas for action in response to the findings. 

Throughout the SAPA process, there is an emphasis on linking the steps to stakeholder engagement, either through discussions, or feedback, or actions to improve the situation. This ensures that stakeholders, including communities through their representatives, are effectively engaged throughout the assessment. 

This multi-stakeholder approach increases the accuracy and credibility of the findings, enhances transparency and ownership of the assessment process, builds support for action and accountability for implementation.

The main phases of the SAPA include:

Preparing
  Planning
  Community mapping
  Stakeholder analysis
  Training
  
Scoping
  First community meeting and stakeholder workshop
  
Information Gathering
  Planning
  Develop household survey
  Train enumerators
  Conduct household survey
  Analyse household survey data
  
Assessing
  Second community meeting and stakeholder workshop
  
Taking Action
  Communicate results
  Plan actions
  Monitor progress

For those interested, much greater detail can be found in the SAPA manual @franks_social_2018.

# Findings

## Positive Social Impacts


Soysambu conservancy’s initiative to offer sponsorship opportunities for students, enabling access to education and fostering academic achievement, was seen as a positive social impact by some households. Additionally, Soysambu's contributions to local schools, such as providing school meals for students, school uniforms, desks, and sports equipment, positively impact educational outcomes and student well-being. The Conservancy also provides free guided educational trips to community members, offering valuable learning experiences and fostering appreciation for conservation efforts.

Soysambu conservancy’s support for health projects, including the provision of equipment to clinics and cancer screening for women, contributed to improved healthcare access and outcomes within the community. Additionally, Soysambu Conservancy also provided anti-rabies vaccinations for dogs and donkeys, demonstrating a commitment to community health.

Soysambu conservancy provides water to the community either through trucks or by building water tanks, ensuring access to clean and safe water for local residents. 

Soysambu conservancy's support in building or maintaining infrastructure including police posts, schools, and roads, were reported to enhance the overall quality of life for community members.

Soysambu conservancy also offered outreach services in the form of training in improved livestock production, health, and waste management, empowering residents with valuable knowledge and skills.

Soysambu actively participates in environmental conservation initiatives, such as tree planting, contributing to the preservation of natural resources and biodiversity. Moreover, Soysambu offers support to bush-clearing workers by providing firewood for free, demonstrating a commitment to employee welfare and community support.

```{r, fig.cap='Overall positive impacts across all communities', fig.align='center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/positive impacts overall.png')
```

## Positive Impacts per Location

The findings of the household survey reveal diverse perspectives across the four locations. When the survey respondents were asked about how important projects previously implemented by Soysambu were to their households the majority of respondents from Kiptangwani location assigned a rating of zero, indicating little importance. A significant portion expressed low importance, while only a few acknowledged medium to high importance, particularly concerning water provision and infrastructure development.

In Mbaruk location, respondents indicated that the previously mentioned projects had zero impact on their households, with very few attributing medium to high importance to them. 
In the Oljorai location, the influence of Soysambu Conservancy on the community appears notably positive. A majority of respondents affirmed the high importance of the projects to their households, with a significant number rating them as of medium importance. Fewer respondents indicated zero importance, while a minimal number expressed low importance.

The findings revealed mixed perceptions among residents within Soysambu regarding the significance of various projects. While a considerable number regarded most projects as of high importance, some perceived certain initiatives e.g sponsorship opportunities for students and community education programs, as having zero importance to their households. Consequently, the number of respondents expressing medium importance to the projects was minimal.

```{r, fig.cap='Positive impacts broken down into separate locations', fig.align='center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/positive impacts by location.png')
```

## Negative Social Impacts

Although Soysambu Conservancy have made considerable efforts to improve relationships with communities within and neighbouring the conservancy, there are still a number of impacts that are having negative impacts on household well-being.

The findings from discussions with community representatives and the household surveys indicate that transmission of disease from wildlife and livestock in Soysambu to local livestock poses a significant concern for community members. Human-wildlife conflict also dominates in the area with wildlife originating from Soysambu exacerbating tensions and challenges for residents. Examples include the damage to crops, livestock and other property; injury of people; and lack of compensation for damage and injury by wildlife from Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Moreover, restricted access to certain public utilities, such as roads, creates barriers to mobility and community well-being.

Respondents also said that Soysambu-related benefits are unfairly shared, for example, there was main concern on limited employment opportunities and a lack of prioritisation in employment within Soysambu. This together with the exclusion of the local community from involvement in development projects perpetuates feelings of exclusion. 

There is also a perceived lack of appreciation from Soysambu Conservancy when they receive assistance from the community, such as when the community assists in putting out fires during dry seasons. Limited access to grazing areas and restrictions on tree cutting within Soysambu Conservancy compound the challenges faced by local residents.


```{r, fig.cap='Overall negative impacts across all communities', fig.align='center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/negative impacts overall.png')
```

## Negative Impacts per Location

The assessment findings suggest that respondents in Oljorai location considered all of the highlighted negative impacts as of high importance, implying a detrimental effect on their household well-being.  Fewer respondents felt that the impacts were of medium importance while a number of them fel that some impacts were of zero importance for example conflict with wildlife, little grazing access to Soysambu and community not being prioritised in employment by Soysambu. 

Opinions among respondents in Kiptangwani location were varied when it came to negative impacts. A significant majority of respondents highlighted that all negative impacts were of high importance and thus had a lot of impact on their household wellbeing, except for the restriction of access to public utilities, where most respondents expressed a perception of zero importance. Some respondents cited the negative impacts as having low importance, while others had no opinion at all.
